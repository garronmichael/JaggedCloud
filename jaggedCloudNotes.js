Did not use GitHub Issues, what is Waffle.io?
Advice: Set up slack, notetaker, trello, spike, meetings: after sprint reflection, after lunch, after dinner and before we leave

Strengths: Angular, Backbone, SQL, Azure
Fair: Node, Express, HTML/CSS
Weaknesses: Mongo, Grunt, Gulp, Mocha/Chai, D3, **authentication**
Tech Goals: node/express server, angularui-router, mongoDB schema, heroku or AWS, gunt continuous integration, facebook & twitter authentication, testing
Group Goals: want everyone to feel like their contribution is significant and that everyone understands the whole project

Lauren
  S: whiteboarding, drawing out thoughts, verbalizing thoughts, schema design
  W: understanding the moving parts and how all the files are communicating to each other, really likes modularity, spatial learning, backend servers
  G: better understand complexity of an app, esp servers and how all the files talk to each other, really wants to know what every person did, step by
     step decisions
   : server, deployment, database, deployment authentication

Michael 
  S: backend, handle large code base, understanding different parts and ignoring complexity, learn APIs quickly
  W: CSS/HTML, jQuery, user experience/interface
  G: angular, not servers
